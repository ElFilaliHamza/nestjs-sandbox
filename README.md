# Paginate Example

A NestJS learning project where I'm exploring different packages and features to understand how they work.

## What's This About?

I'm using this project to get hands-on experience with NestJS. I wanted to see how pagination works in practice, so I started with `nestjs-paginate`. Along the way, I've been adding other features like CSV exports and Protobuf support just to see how everything fits together.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

## Why This Exists

Honestly, I'm mostly just learning and experimenting here. I wanted to understand NestJS better by actually building something rather than just reading docs. This is my sandbox for trying out different packages and seeing what works well together.
